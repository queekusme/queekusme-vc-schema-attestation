1.  Introduction

1.1.  Trust in the Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model

   Implementations of the Issuer-Holder-Verifier model have created
   solutions for the problem of trust in the issuance of and attestation
   of verifiers for verifiable credentials.  Wallets and verifiers MAY
   subscribe to specific trust anchors to verify:

   *  A Verifiable Credential has been issued by an authorised issuer
   *  A verifier is authorised to receive a Verifiable Credential

   Whilst certain wallets can subscribe to a closed system for trust,
   others MAY wish to accept credentials from any issuer allowing the
   holder of the aforementioned Credential to present and have verified
   any Verifiable Credential.

   The Wallet would need to determine the correct trust anchors to
   subscribe to in order to ascertain the correct level of trust in
   Credential issuers and verifiers

1.2.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

1.3.  Terms and Definitions

   This specification uses the terms "Holder", "Issuer", "Verifier",
   "Disclosure", "Selectively Disclosable JWT (SD-JWT)", "Key Binding",
   "Key Binding JWT (KB-JWT)", "Selectively Disclosable JWT with Key
   Binding (SD-JWT+KB)" defined by
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

   Verifiable Credential (VC):  An assertion with claims about a Subject
      that is cryptographically secured by an Issuer (usually by a
      digital signature).

1.4.  Verifiable Credential Schema documents

   Verifiable Credential Schema are documents which define the structure
   of verifiable credentials in a manner which allows verifiers and
   other external software and tooling to determine if a Credential
   conforms to the schema design.

   The Verifiable Credential formats which utilize schema documents are:

   *  W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model (VCDM) 2.0 [W3C.VCDM] which
      uses JSON-LD as its structure definition
   *  SD-JWT-based Verifiable Credentials [I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc]
      which uses its own defined vct structure definition.

   MDoc Credential formats are outside of the scope of this document

   Both [W3C.VCDM] and [I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc] permit schema document
   definition via URL request.

2.  Verifiable Credential Schema Attestation Document

2.1.  Schema Attestation Document Request

2.1.1.  Schema Document Attestation Well-known Endpoint

   Schema designers MAY make a Schema Attestation Document available at
   the location formed by inserting the well known string /.well-known/
   schema-attestation between the host component and the path component
   of the Schema URL

   The following is a non-normative example of an HTTP request for the
   Schema Attestation Document when the Schema Document url is
   http://example.com/example-credential.json

   GET /.well-known/schema-attestation/example-credential.json HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

2.1.2.  Request Parameters (SD-JWT Response)

   Schema Attestation Document creators MAY support receiving
   application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoded request parameters.  A
   request sent with application/x-www-form-urlencoded parameters MUST
   be sent using the POST method.

   The following parameters are defined to be included in the request to
   the Request URI Endpoint:

   *  issuer: OPTIONAL.  The Issuer to receive attestation information
      for if present in the Attestation Document
   *  verifier: OPTIONAL.  The Verifier to receive attestation
      information for if present in the Attestation Document
   *  nonce: OPTIONAL.  A nonce ensuring the freshness of the signature
      in JWT responses

   A POST Request with no Request Parameters MUST be handled the same as
   a GET request to the same well-known endpoint.

   The following is a non-normative example of an HTTP request for the
   Schema Attestation Document requesting attestation information for an
   issuer http://example.com/issuer

   POST /.well-known/schema-attestation/example-credential.json HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   issuer=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fissuer

   The Schema Attestation Document MAY tailor the response if a HTTP
   Accept Header is provided.  If the server cannot handle the provided
   Accept Header, The server SHOULD respond with 406 Not Acceptable HTTP

2.2.  Schema Attestation Document Response

   A successful response MUST use the 200 OK HTTP.  The Content-Type
   header MUST be used to inform the requester of the format of the
   Schema Attestation Document.

   *  application/json where the returned document is an unsigned and
      plain JSON document
   *  application/jwt where the returned document is a signed JSON Web
      token [RFC7519]
   *  application/sd-jwt where the returned document is a Selective
      Disclosure JWT [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt]

   It is RECOMMENDED that Schema Attestation Document creators return a
   Selective Disclosure JWT.

2.2.1.  JOSE Header

   This section defines JWT header parameters for the JWT and SD-JWT
   response formats.

   When Attestation Documents are returned as a JWT or an SD-JWT the typ
   header MUST be present.

   The following typ values MUST be used to indicate the type of the
   relevant JWT:

   *  schema-attestation+jwt: a JWT Response with No Selective
      Disclosures
   *  schema-attestation+sd-jwt: an SD-JWT Response which MAY include
      Selective Disclosures

   The following is a non-normative example of a decoded SD-JWT header:

   {
     "alg": "ES256",
     "typ": "schema-attestation+sd-jwt"
   }

2.2.2.  Schema Attestation Document Claims

   If a Content-Type of application/json is returned, the JSON document
   SHOULD match the unsigned payload of the JWT responses

   The specification defines the following JWT claims:

   *  iss: REQUIRED.  The issuer of the document, MUST be a [W3C.DID]
      identifier
   *  sub: REQUIRED.  The string schema document URL.  This being the
      [W3C.VCDM] credentialSchema.id URL or the
      [I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc] vct URL.
   *  sub#integrity: REQUIRED.  A string containing the [W3C.SRI]
      integrity of the Schema Document this Attestation points to.
   *  authorized_issuers: OPTIONAL.  An array of strings containing the
      issuers which are authorised to issue credentials matching the
      Schema. authorized_issuers MAY be an empty array.
      authorized_issuers and its values SHOULD be Selectively
      Disclosable.
   *  authorized_verifiers: OPTIONAL.  An array of strings containing
      the verifiers which are authorised to issue credentials matching
      the Schema. authorized_issuers MAY be an empty array.
      authorized_verifiers and its values SHOULD be Selectively
      Disclosable.
   *  nonce: REQUIRED if included in POST Request Parameters, otherwise
      OPTIONAL.  The nonce provided by the requester, ensures signature
      freshness

   REQUIRED claims MUST NOT be Selectively Disclosable.

   JWT claims iat, nbf and exp SHOULD be used to establish timeframes
   for the acceptance and disposal of expired Attestation JWTs.  These
   claims are all OPTIONAL when returned as a plain application/json
   document and MUST NOT be Selectively Disclosable in SD-JWT responses.

2.2.2.1.  authorized_issuers format

   For an Issuer to be attested as Authorized to issue a Credential
   matching the respective Schema the value in the authorized_issuers
   array MUST match the issuer value of a [W3C.VCDM] Credential or the
   iss value of a [I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc] Credential.

2.2.2.2.  authorized_verifiers format

   For a verifier to be attested as Authorised to receive a Credential
   matching the respective Schema the value in the authorized_verifiers
   array MUST match one of the following:

   *  For an [OAUTH.OID4VP] presentation which presents the credential
      request as a request_uri JWT, the iss value MUST match the value
      in authorized_verifiers
   *  TODO: Identify other methods for identifying verifiers within a
      credential request

2.2.3.  Verifying Schema Attestation Documents

   Recipients of Schema Attestation Documents returned as JWTs or SD-
   JWTs MUST verify the returned JWT or SD-JWT.  The iss claim included
   in the JWT or SD-JWT payload SHOULD be used to identify the issuer of
   the Schema Attestation.

   The iss claim MUST be a [W3C.DID] identifier, which permits DID
   resolution for public key identification.

2.2.4.  Selective Disclosure

   If Request Parameters are provided in a POST request and the Schema
   Attestation Document is available as an SD-JWT, the document MUST
   return Disclosures matching the requested issuer or verifier

   Selective Disclosure JWT Responses SHOULD use Decoy Digests to
   disguise the actual number of authorized issuers and verifiers.

2.2.5.  Schema Extension

   [I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc] permits vct documents to extend from
   another vct document.  As a Schema Attestation Document attests for a
   specific version of a Schema document, the document the vct extends
   from MAY have its own attestation document.

   Schema Document Requests MUST NOT inherit Attestation from higher
   order Schema Attestation Documents.

3.  Security Considerations

3.1.  Issuer/Verifier POST Request for Information Discovery

   If a Schema attestation Document is made available as an SD-JWT,
   requests to the well-known endpoint MAY use the issuer and verifier
   Request parameters in order to perform information discovery on the
   Disclosures within a SD-JWT Attestation Document.

   Schema Attestation Document Providers SHOULD make effort to prevent
   Information Discovery utilizing methods such as Rate Limiting.

   Nonce values which are reused SHOULD be rejected if multiple requests
   from the same requester are received with the same nonce value.

3.2.  Schema Extension as a method for attaining a trusted status.

   An attacker MAY extend a known Schema document and provide their own
   Schema Attestation document in order to show themselves as 'verified'
   to Wallets and Verifiers.

   Whilst extension remains a valid method for building upon existing
   schema, Wallets SHOULD NOT treat extended documents as an attempt to
   bypass trust.  Wallets SHOULD show credentials with extended Schema
   as Trusted, so long as the issuer is correctly included as an
   authorized_issuers in the extended Schema's Schema Attestation
   Document.

   [OAUTH.OID4VP] includes the specification for Digital Credentials
   Query Language (DCQL).  DCQL introduces meta which allows for the
   specification of metadata associated with a Credential request.

   For [I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc] Credentials, the meta object MAY
   contain the vct_values key, which contains a non-empty array of
   strings.  A wallet MAY return Credentials that inherit from any type
   specified.  This means that imitation credentials MAY be provided and
   cannot be relied upon to filter imitation credentials.

   Verifiers therefore SHOULD ensure that the Schema in [W3C.VCDM]
   credentialSchema.id or [I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc] vct values match
   the expected Schema.
